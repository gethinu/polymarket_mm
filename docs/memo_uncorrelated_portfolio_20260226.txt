Primary analysis artifact:
- logs/uncorrelated_portfolio_proxy_analysis_20260226.json

Objective
- Evaluate cross-strategy correlation and estimate expected return / risk impact for concurrent operation of 5 ADOPTED observe-only strategies.

Strategies
- weather_clob_arb_buckets_observe
- no_longshot_daily_observe
- link_intake_walletseed_cohort_observe
- gamma_eventpair_exec_edge_filter_observe
- hourly_updown_highprob_calibration_observe

1) Extracted realized/observe metrics and daily series availability

A. weather_clob_arb_buckets_observe
- Canonical realized daily series: logs/strategy_realized_pnl_daily.jsonl
- Realized daily return metric: realized_pnl_usd / bankroll_usd
- Realized days: 3 (2026-02-24 .. 2026-02-26), all zero -> zero variance
- Observe proxy series used for correlation fallback:
  - source: logs/clob-arb-weather-observe-24h.log
  - metric: daily median EDGE pct from summary lines
  - days: 3 (2026-02-22, 2026-02-25, 2026-02-26)

B. no_longshot_daily_observe
- Canonical realized daily series: logs/no_longshot_realized_daily.jsonl
- Realized daily return metric: realized_return_pct
- Realized days: 2 (2026-02-25, 2026-02-26)
- Canonical monthly KPI authority:
  - logs/strategy_register_latest.json -> no_longshot_status.monthly_return_now_text = -18.96%
- Observe proxy series used for correlation robustness:
  - source: logs/no_longshot_daily_samples.csv
  - metric: daily cost-weighted pnl_per_no_share / entry_yes_price
  - days: 76

C. link_intake_walletseed_cohort_observe
- Strategy-level daily return/PnL series: not found
- Available observe metric snapshots:
  - logs/linkseed_7links_link_intake_summary_*.json
  - metric used: daily mean cohort_ok score (1/0)
  - days: 1 (2026-02-25)

D. gamma_eventpair_exec_edge_filter_observe
- Strategy-level realized daily return/PnL series: not found
- Available observe metrics:
  - logs/clob-arb-monitor-metrics-eventpair*.jsonl
  - proxy metric: daily mean edge_pct_exec_est for strategy=event-yes and passes_exec_threshold=true
  - days: 4 (2026-02-22 .. 2026-02-26)
- Monthly proxy used for expected return estimate:
  - logs/clob-arb-eventpair-monthly-estimate-adopt-extended2ab-20260225.json
  - recommended_monthly_return = +2.8736%

E. hourly_updown_highprob_calibration_observe
- Strategy-level realized daily return/PnL series: not found
- Available observe metric:
  - logs/hourly_updown_highprob_calibration_168h_tte45_70_95_btc_eth_sol_xrp.json
  - proxy metric: daily cost-weighted realized return from qualified samples
  - days: 8 (2026-02-18 .. 2026-02-25)
- Monthly return mapping for deployed bankroll: not available in logs

2) Pairwise correlation estimation (daily proxy series)

Computed pairs (corr, overlap days):
- weather vs no_longshot: +0.7566 (3d)
- weather vs gamma_eventpair: -0.6516 (3d)
- weather vs hourly_updown: -1.0000 (2d; unstable)
- no_longshot vs gamma_eventpair: +0.0030 (3d)
- no_longshot vs hourly_updown: -0.3773 (5d)
- gamma_eventpair vs hourly_updown: +0.4054 (3d)
- Any pair with link_intake: insufficient (overlap_days < 2)

Low-correlation threshold used: |corr| <= 0.30
- Qualified low-correlation pair: no_longshot_daily_observe vs gamma_eventpair_exec_edge_filter_observe (corr=+0.0030)

3) Minimal uncorrelated set recommendation

Recommended minimal set (provisional):
- { no_longshot_daily_observe, gamma_eventpair_exec_edge_filter_observe }

Reason:
- It is the only pair that simultaneously satisfies:
  - low observed correlation under threshold (|corr| <= 0.30)
  - monthly return proxies available for both members

4) Expected return improvement and risk reduction estimate

Assumptions:
- Equal weight (50/50)
- Monthly proxy for no_longshot from canonical key in strategy_register_latest.json
- Monthly proxy for gamma_eventpair from adopted extended2ab estimate file
- Correlation and risk computed from proxy daily series (not pure realized PnL series)

Estimated monthly return (proxy):
- no_longshot: -18.96%
- gamma_eventpair: +2.8736%
- equal-weight portfolio: (-18.96% + 2.8736%) / 2 = -8.0432%

Interpretation:
- Improvement vs no_longshot solo: +10.9168 percentage points (less negative)
- Decrease vs gamma_eventpair solo: -10.9168 percentage points

Estimated risk reduction (proxy volatility):
- overlap days for risk calc: 3 (2026-02-22, 2026-02-25, 2026-02-26)
- std(no_longshot proxy): 0.08197
- std(gamma proxy): 0.14829
- std(equal-weight portfolio proxy): 0.08483
- reduction vs average standalone std: about 26.32%

Confidence:
- LOW (very short overlap window, proxy metrics mixed in definition)

5) Explicit missing metrics by strategy

- weather_clob_arb_buckets_observe
  - Missing: non-zero-variance realized daily return history (>=30 days preferred)
- no_longshot_daily_observe
  - Missing: longer canonical realized daily history and overlap with other strategy realized series
- link_intake_walletseed_cohort_observe
  - Missing: strategy-level daily return/PnL series (currently only cohort quality snapshots)
- gamma_eventpair_exec_edge_filter_observe
  - Missing: strategy-level realized daily return/PnL series (currently edge proxy and monthly estimate)
- hourly_updown_highprob_calibration_observe
  - Missing: strategy-level realized daily return/PnL series and bankroll-normalized monthly return mapping

Operational note:
- This memo uses observe proxies where realized daily returns are absent.
- For investment-grade covariance and portfolio optimization, standardize all 5 strategies to one daily return definition and accumulate at least 30 overlapping days.
