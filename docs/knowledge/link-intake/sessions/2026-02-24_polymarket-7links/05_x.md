# Link Note 05

- source_url: `https://x.com/SynthdataCo/status/2021658564109234501`
- source_type: `x_status`
- confidence: `high` (retry capture)
- capture_gaps:
  - image figures not OCR-transcribed
  - no independent verification of quoted edge/performance claims

## captured_claims

- Claim: a bot can be moved from thesis to live testing quickly using Synth + Openclaw.
- Claim: in hourly crypto up/down markets, with ~20 minutes remaining, contracts around `85c` can be mispriced versus model probabilities (example `92c`).
- Claim: observed opportunities can exceed `10%` edge under their model estimate.
- Claim: Kelly sizing can be used from model edge.

## actionable_rules

- Convert model-vs-market mismatch into an explicit entry rule: trigger only when `model_prob - market_price >= edge_threshold`.
- Keep execution cost-aware: treat gross edge claims as invalid unless net of fees/slippage remains positive.
- Treat this source as a hypothesis definition, not as validated expected return.

## required_data

- Time-aligned model probability stream (Synth forecasts).
- Time-aligned Polymarket contract prices and liquidity.
- Fee/slippage assumptions and realized fill outcomes.
- Settlement outcomes for realized expectancy checks.

## entry_exit_logic

- Entry candidate: remaining time near the short-end window (source example: ~20 minutes), and edge threshold passed.
- Sizing: fractional Kelly or fixed-size fallback.
- Exit: settlement-based realized PnL accounting (source text does not define robust early-exit rules).

## risk_notes

- Third-party model dependency risk (forecast quality drift).
- Execution friction can erase nominal edge in short-dated contracts.
- Social-post narratives can selectively report favorable examples.

## observe_only_test_plan

- Build an observe-only replay that logs `(model_prob, market_price, edge, time_to_end)` snapshots.
- Run calibration on closed hourly up/down samples:
  - `python scripts/report_hourly_updown_highprob_calibration.py --assets bitcoin,ethereum --hours 72 --tte-minutes 20 --price-min 0.80 --price-max 0.95 --max-trades-per-market 3000 --pretty`
- Compute fee-adjusted expectancy by edge buckets before any live consideration.
- Require minimum sample size and out-of-sample stability checks.

## open_questions

- Exact model endpoint and forecast timestamp alignment are not specified in the post.
- Whether reported edges are gross or net of all costs is not specified.
- Position concurrency and bankroll caps are not specified.
