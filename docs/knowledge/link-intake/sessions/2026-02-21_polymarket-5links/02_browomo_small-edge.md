# Link 02: browomo Small-Edge Framing

Source URL:
- `https://x.com/browomo/status/2024075205245534532`

Capture status:
- `low`

Captured points:
- Framing: `small edge x many positions x low correlation`.
- Points to `@c0O0OLI0O0O0` wallet as operational example.

Known gaps:
- `thread_or_post_truncated_show_more`
- `quoted_post_context_may_be_partial`
- `image_text_not_ocr`

Evidence artifacts:
- `logs/link_intake_raw_20260221_050409/02.txt`
- `logs/memo0221_intake.json`
- `docs/knowledge/link-intake/sessions/2026-02-21_polymarket-5links/04_velon_micro-moves.md`

Implementation notes (observe-only):
- Treat this source as thesis-level context, not direct parameter source.
- Use link [04] plus wallet autopsy data to derive executable behavior assumptions.

Open questions:
- Are there non-text claims in the embedded media that change the strategy definition?
