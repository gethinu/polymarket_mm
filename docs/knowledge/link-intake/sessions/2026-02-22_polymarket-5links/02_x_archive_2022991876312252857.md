## captured_claims

- Main niche mentioned: BTC 5-minute up/down markets.
- Claimed setup: buy panic-sold low-priced outcomes (`$0.03-$0.07`) on reversal expectation.
- Claimed payoff asymmetry: large upside multiples vs small bounded per-trade loss.

## actionable_rules

- Treat as a contrarian directional strategy, separate from pure arbitrage.
- Build observe-only filter for deep-tail prices with reversal confirmation gate.
- Track hit-rate and expectancy; do not trust promotional win-rate claims without data.

## required_data

- Short-window market order book and last traded prices.
- External BTC spot stream for reversal signal candidate.
- Timestamped signal/entry logs with price bucket tags.

## entry_exit_logic

- Candidate entry bucket: very low price outcomes (configurable lower/upper cents band).
- Directional trigger: reversal proxy from external spot momentum/mean-reversion feature.
- Exit: payout at resolution or pre-resolution target/stop in simulation.

## risk_notes

- Ultra-low priced contracts can remain low due to information, not panic.
- Tail contracts may have poor depth and adverse selection.
- Claimed payout multiples can be biased by selective examples.

## observe_only_test_plan

- Replay/forward observe with fixed bankroll simulation.
- Measure calibration by bucket (`3-5c`, `5-7c`, etc.).
- Report expectancy and drawdown, not only win-rate.

## open_questions

- Precise reversal definition is unspecified in text.
- Whether trades are maker, taker, or mixed is unspecified.
