  - video details not transcribed
  - teaser text ends before concrete rule disclosure

## captured_claims

- Claims of extreme account growth from small starting capital.
- Claims strategy comes from deep market understanding and trade analysis.
- Post references prior copy-trading setup context.

## actionable_rules

- Treat as a hypothesis trigger, not a direct strategy spec.
- Validate account path via independently fetched trade history.
- Reject performance claims unless reproducible with observe-only replay.

## required_data

- Ground-truth trade ledger for the referenced wallet/account.
- Time-aligned market states for each claimed compounding step.
- Replay engine with realistic fees/slippage.

## entry_exit_logic

- Not defined in available text.
- Must be inferred only after quantitative autopsy of trades.

## risk_notes

- Extreme-return narratives often understate selection bias.
- Small-capital compounding can be path-dependent and non-repeatable.
- Missing detail makes overfitting likely if inferred too aggressively.

## observe_only_test_plan

- Run wallet autopsy tooling on candidate reference wallets.
- Recompute theoretical growth under conservative execution assumptions.
- Report confidence intervals and failure scenarios.

## open_questions

- Which exact wallet/trades correspond to the claim is not explicit in this post text.
- Whether returns are realized, mark-to-market, or mixed is unspecified.
