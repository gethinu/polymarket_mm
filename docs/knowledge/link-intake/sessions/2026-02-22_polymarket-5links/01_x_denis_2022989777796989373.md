## captured_claims

- Some legacy Polymarket "ClawBots" stopped trading.
- A named arbitrage bot previously had high weekly profit but has recently gone inactive.
- Claim: arbitrage opportunities still exist where `UP + DOWN < $1`.

## actionable_rules

- Implement a dedicated observe-only monitor for binary sum-to-one dislocations (`YES + NO < payout`).
- Focus first on short-window crypto markets where repricing speed is high.
- Log all candidate edges and false positives for threshold tuning.

## required_data

- CLOB top-of-book asks for both outcomes in one binary market.
- Per-market metadata: liquidity, spread, end time, volume24hr.
- Candidate-level edge metrics over time.

## entry_exit_logic

- Entry condition (observe simulation): `(ask_yes + ask_no) * shares + costs < payout`.
- No directional view required; this is a basket pricing dislocation monitor.
- Exit (observe): mark-to-close via payout assumption and realized simulation in existing monitor framework.

## risk_notes

- Fast competition can erase edge before fill.
- Fee-enabled markets may invalidate apparent edge if fee handling is wrong.
- Source is promotional/social; verify by logged market microstructure, not text claims.

## observe_only_test_plan

- Run realtime monitor in observe mode with strict min-edge threshold.
- Compare `signal_count`, `persisted_edge_ms`, and estimated net edge after costs.
- Keep execution disabled and archive metrics to `logs/`.

## open_questions

- Is the claim mainly about 5m windows, 15m windows, or both?
- Are opportunities concentrated in one token family (BTC only) or broader crypto binaries?
